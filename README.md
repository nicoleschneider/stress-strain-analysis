# stress-strain-analysis

## Overview
Collaborative project between Engineering and Computer Science at Loyola University Maryland
with the goal to use image analysis to accurately measure the stress-strain on deforemed copper specimens.

In this repo is code to make width measurements along the entire length of the copper specimen using a high resolution photograph of the specimen. Methods include an edge-detection algorithm, and connected-component analysis to automatically locate the border between the specimen and the background. 

## Future Goal
Do this dynamically over many snapshots so that stress-strain can be calculated in real time as the specimen is being deformed.
